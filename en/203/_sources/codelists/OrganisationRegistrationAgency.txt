Organisation Registration Agency
================================



The values from this codelist are used to identify the particular list that an organisation identifier was drawn from. The codelist provides a list of known identifier lists, including national company registers, NGO lists and international and multilateral lists - along with links to sources where specific organisation numbers and identifiers can be looked up.

As of 17 July 2017 the Organisation Registration Agency codelist (now organisation identifier list) is maintained centrally by org-id.guide. Open data publishers can now locate organisation identifiers using this website. IATI replicates the list directly from org-id.guide with the exception of the XI-IATI codelist. IATI still maintains the XI-IATI organisation identifier list, which is used  when there are no other available lists that might be used to provide a stable organisation identifier.

If an organisation identifier list that you wish to use cannot be found in org-id.guide, you can submit a direct request on Github (https://github.com/org-id/register/issues) or email contact@org-id.guide






This is a :ref:`Non-Embedded codelist <non_embedded_codelist>`.
